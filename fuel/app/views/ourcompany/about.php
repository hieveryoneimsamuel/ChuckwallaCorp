    <h3>Chuckwalla Corp Foundations</h3>
    <p>Chuckwalla Corporation was founded to provide vegan articles of clothing inspired by the patterns of a chuckwalla. 
        These herbivourous lizards are located in southwestern deserts in the United States. Their orange 
        and yellow hues caught the attention of the founders, who dedicated the company to the beauty of these creatures.
